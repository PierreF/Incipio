Feature: Authenticate users
  The authentication system should work application wide.
  It should be possible to authenticate the login form.

  Scenario: Feature fixtures
    Given the database is empty
    Then the fixtures file "authentication.yml" is loaded

  Scenario Outline: Authenticate via the login page should redirect to the home page.
  Once logged in, the login page is inaccessible.
  It should be possible to log out.
    Given I am on "/login"
    When I fill in the following:
      | username | <username> |
      | password | <password> |
    And I press "Se connecter"
    Then I should be on "/"
    And I should see ""
    And I should not see "Se connecter"
    When I go to "/login"
    Then I am on "/"
    When I follow "Se d√©connecter"
    Then I am on "/login"

  Examples:
    | username             | password |
    | admin                | admin    |
    | admin@incipio.fr     | admin    |

    Then I should be on "/users/"
