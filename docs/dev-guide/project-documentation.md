# Project documentation

Incipio documentation is generated with [Mkdocs][1]. To contribute to the documentation, you will find everything inside the `docs` folder and the configuration in `mkdocs.yml`.

[Mkdocs][1] is builded using Python. As such to run it locally you will have to check [Mkdocs installation process](http://www.mkdocs.org/#installation). It is pre-installed with the Vagrant VM, to use it, check the `mkdocs` command.

To start to see the doc, run `mkdocs serve` in the project folder.
